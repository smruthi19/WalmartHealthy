How It Works:
The website works by allowing the user to browse different products by category: vegetables, fruits, dairy and grains and the related price. Upon selecting a category, the user can select the product that they wish to add to their cart and purchase, which will display the product details page. The product details page includes the product details about the selected item, which includes the local farm address and certified operation pertaining to the product, generated from the database of organic foods. Selecting add to cart, will calculate the price of the product based on the quantity selected.
